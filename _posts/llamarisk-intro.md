## Who are we?
We are an independent team of passionate Curve community members funded by the Curve Grants Council. Our views are our own and do not represent Curve.fi's opinions/views.

If you’re interested in getting immediate updates on current events, follow us on Twitter.

## What do we do?
LlamaRisk conducts due diligence on topics relevant to Curve DAO and its liquidity providers. Our reports are often asset risk assessments that deep dive into the mechanics and risk vectors of assets listed on the Curve AMM. Typically these are DeFi protocols that issue stablecoins, pegged assets, or liquid staking derivatives, although we also look into centralized stablecoin issuers.

We view our work as a public good to Curve and its users, and we also seek to support and strengthen relations between Curve and the protocols which we review.

If you’d like to get involved with the work we are doing, join our discord server.
